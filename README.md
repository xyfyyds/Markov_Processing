Arbitrating Energy Users and Battery Storage Systems in Residentials using 

Markov-Chain Modelling

### **Scope**

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, Research, Simulation

### **Project description**

Battery Storage System (BSS) are extensively used in smart electrical grids 

particularly in providing required reserve and response services. BSS can enhance 

flexibility and enable high levels of renewable energy integration and therefore 

unlock many protentional BSS providers in participating electricity balancing 

markets. However, scheduling efficient energy management system operations in 

responding to unstable customer demand is challenging even with the well

established machine learning model as there are complicated by weather-related 

conditions and usersâ€™ randomised behaviour. Therefore, this project aims to 

research and develop an intelligent battery storage control energy management 

system based on reinforcement learning model focusing on residentials connected 

to the grid with solar panel and BSS. The Markov Process will be used to capture 

and stimulate randomised energy demand, prices, absorption of solar energy, and 

thereafter the charging and discharging of BSS. 

### **Keywords**

Energy Management System, Battery Storage System, Reinforcement Learning, Q-Learning

### **Main tasks**

1. Review the state-of-art technological used in BSS modelling including present 

limitations and challenges.

2. Gather the important dataset for the later model development, training, and 

verification.

3. Apply the reinforcement learning to classify and train the dataset in the model.

4. Implement the model and verify the necessary performance. Finally, report 

findings and preparation of the thesis.

### **Measurable outcomes**

1.  A deterministic pattern of energy management system with demand, price, and 

BSS control.

2. A working demo of complicated Markovian model

3. Decomposition and classification of dataset
